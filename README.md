# PUSH SWAP
Just a side project to grill my Go lang skill, get me out from comfort zone (since I am not a Go person)

## How to run

## Checker function

## How to unit test

This project includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the utility functions.

To run all tests, execute the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
go test ./...
```

This command will discover and run all test files (files ending in `_test.go`) in all sub-packages.
